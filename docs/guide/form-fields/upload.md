# Upload

Class: `Code16\Sharp\Form\Fields\SharpFormUploadField`

![Example](./upload.gif)

## General configuration

First, in order to get the upload part working, you have to define a "tmp" path where files will be stored until they are moved to the final folder. Here's the default:

```php
// in config/sharp.php

"uploads" => [
    "tmp_dir" => env("SHARP_UPLOADS_TMP_DIR", "tmp"),
]
```

This `tmp_dir` path is relative to the `local` filesystem defined in the Laravel configuration.


## Field Configuration

### `setMaxFileSize(float $sizeInMB)`

Max file size allowed.

### `setCropRatio(string $ratio, array $croppableFileTypes = null)`

Set a ratio constraint to uploaded images, formatted like this: `width:height`. For instance: `16:9`, or `1:1`.

When a crop ratio is set, any uploaded picture will be auto-cropped (centered).

The second argument, `$croppableFileTypes`, provide a way to limit the crop configuration to a list of image files extensions. For instance, it can be useful to define a crop for jpg and png, but not for gif because it will destroy animation.

### `setStorageDisk(string $storageDisk)`

Set the destination storage disk (as configured in Laravel's  `config/filesystem.php` config file).

### `setStorageBasePath(string $storageBasePath)`

Set the destination base storage path. You can use the `{id}` special placeholder to add the instance id in the path.

For instance:
`$field->setStorageBasePath('/users/{id}/avatar')`

### `setFileFilter($fileFilter)`

Set the allowed file extensions. You can pass either an array or a comma-separated list.

### `setFileFilterImages()`

Just a `setFileFilter([".jpg",".jpeg",".gif",".png"])` shorthand.

### `setCompactThumbnail($compactThumbnail = true)`

If true and if the upload has a thumbnail, it is limited to 60px high (to compact in a list item, for instance).


## Formatter

This part is more complex for this field than others...

First, let's mention that Sharp provides an Eloquent built-in solution for uploads with the `SharpUploadModel` class, as [detailed here](../sharp-built-in-solution-for-uploads.md), which greatly simplify the work.

Here's the documentation for the non built-in solution:


### `toFront`

The front expects an array with three keys:

```php
[
    "name" => "", // Relative file path
    "thumbnail" => "", // 1000px w * 400px h thumbnail full url
    "size" => x, // Size in bytes
]
```

The formatter can't handle it automatically, it too project-specific. You'll have to provide this in a custom transformer ([see full documentation](../how-to-transform-data.md)) like this:

```php
function find($id): array
{
    return $this->setCustomTransformer("picture",
        function($value, $spaceship, $attribute) {
            return [
                "name" => $spaceship->picture->name,
                "thumbnail" => [...],
                "size" => $spaceship->picture->size,
            ];
        })
        ->transform(
            Spaceship::findOrFail($id)
        );
}
```

### `fromFront`

There are four cases:

#### newly uploaded file

The formatter will perform any transformation, store the file on the configured location, and return an array like this:

```php
[
    "file_name" => "", // Relative file path
    "size" => x, // File size in bytes
    "mime_type" => "", // File mime type
    "disk" => "", // Storage disk name
    "transformed" => true // True if the file was transformed
];
```

It's up to you then to store any of these values in a DB or elsewhere.

Using the `Code16\Sharp\Form\Eloquent\WithSharpFormEloquentUpdater`, you will probably reach a solution like this:

```php
function update($id, array $data)
{
    $instance = $id ? Spaceship::findOrFail($id) : new Spaceship;

    $this->ignore("picture")->save($instance, $data);

    // Then handle $data["picture"] here
}
```

#### existing transformed file

In this case, the file was already stored, but was transformed (cropped, or rotated). The formatter will transform the file, store the result and simply return and array with one key:

```php
[
    "transformed" => true
];
```

Then you'll have to catch that if needed (to destroy all previous generated thumbnails for instance).


#### deleted file

The formatter will return null (note that the file **will not** be deleted from the storage).


#### existing and unchanged file

The formatter will return an empty array.
