# Upgrading from 4.0 to 4.1

## Menu syntax was updated

In Sharp 4.0, it was allowed to declare the entity `key`, for menus, like this:

```php
"menu" => [
    [
        "label" => "Equipment",
        "entities" => [
            "spaceship" => [
                "label" => "Spaceships",
                "icon" => "fa-space-shuttle"
            ]
        ]
    ]
]
```

The key => value array syntax is now forbidden, for consistency. The right way is:

```php
"menu" => [
    [
        "label" => "Equipment",
        "entities" => [
            [
                "entity" => "spaceship",  // notice the change here
                "label" => "Spaceships",
                "icon" => "fa-space-shuttle"
            ]
        ]
    ]
]
```

Notice there is now a [dedicated doc section for menus](../building-menu.md).


## Dashboards were generalized

The "only one Dashboard" limitation is gone, bringing more control and features (policies).
As a consequence, if you previously declared a Dashboard, you'll need to adapt your configuration
in `sharp.php`, [as documented here](../dashboard.md), going from this:

```php
return [
    "entities" => [
        [...]
    ],
    "dashboard" => \App\Sharp\Dashboard::class
];
```

to this:

```php
return [
    "entities" => [
        [...]
    ],
    "dashboards" => [
        "dashboard" => [
            "view" => \App\Sharp\Dashboard::class
        ]
    ],
    [...]
    "menu" => [
        [
            "label" => "Company",
            "entities" => [
                [
                    "label" => "My Dashboard",
                    "icon" => "fa-dashboard",
                    "dashboard" => "dashboard"
                ],
                [...]
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
```
